# AutoQAC Project Overview

## Description

AutoQAC is a C# implementation of XEdit-PACT (Plugin Auto Cleaning Tool) using Avalonia UI framework with MVVM architecture. It automates the cleaning of Bethesda game plugins using xEdit tools.

**Foundation Stage**: This project is currently in the foundation/infrastructure stage.

## Technology Stack

- **.NET 9**: Target framework
- **C# 12**: With nullable reference types enabled
- **Avalonia UI 11.3.8**: Cross-platform XAML-based UI framework
- **ReactiveUI**: MVVM framework for reactive programming
- **Fluent Design**: Microsoft Fluent theme for Avalonia
- **YamlDotNet**: YAML configuration handling
- **xUnit + FluentAssertions**: Testing framework

## Essential Commands

```bash
# Build the project
dotnet build

# Run the application
dotnet run --project AutoQAC

# Run tests
dotnet test

# Build release version
dotnet build -c Release

# Clean build artifacts
dotnet clean
```

## Reference Implementation

The `Code_To_Port/` directory contains reference implementations (Python/Qt and Rust/Slint) for feature reference during development. This directory is **temporary** and will be removed once the C# implementation achieves feature parity.

When implementing new features, check `Code_To_Port/` for equivalent functionality first.
